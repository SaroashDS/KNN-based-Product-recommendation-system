![Project Banner](https://github.com/SaroashDS/KNN-based-Product-recommendation-system/assets/144798692/fd0dedc1-3c75-45d2-aed6-b2f0f6afc4af)

## Overview
Welcome to our cutting-edge K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based product recommendation system! Say goodbye to overwhelming online shopping experiences. Our system simplifies the process by using machine learning to recommend similar products based on image classification. Users can upload an image of a personal care or clothing item, and our system suggests related products from our curated dataset of perfume images.

## Problem Statement
In the vast world of online shopping, users often find it challenging to discover products similar to their preferences. Our mission is to alleviate this challenge by leveraging machine learning to recommend similar products based on uploaded images.

## Solution
Our solution utilizes a KNN algorithm trained on features extracted from perfume images using the powerful Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique. When a user uploads an image, our system preprocesses it to extract features. The KNN model then kicks into action, finding the nearest neighbors in the feature space and providing personalized product recommendations.

## Features
- **Image Feature Extraction:** State-of-the-art HOG technique for robust feature extraction from uploaded perfume images.
- **KNN Model:** Efficient implementation of a KNN model to find similar perfumes based on extracted features.
- **Web Interface:** A sleek and user-friendly web-based interface for effortless image uploads and personalized recommendations.
